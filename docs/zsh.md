# zsh dotfiles
The configuration is in `zshrc`

## Overview
* Define the theme: `anxo` is a custom theme based on the `robbyrussell` one.
* Install [Oh my ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* Install some plugins: Some of them: `git`, `docker`, `brew`, `bower`, `npm`, `redis-cli`, `sbt`, `systemd`, `tmux`, `vagrant`, `pip`, `python`
* Define some aliases (i.e. `activate` for venv python activation)

## Background / Foreground
Added a script to execute `fg` once you've sended something to the background.

This way, you can switch from an application (like vim) to the terminal by toggling `c-z`.


I've got the idea from https://sheerun.net/2014/03/21/how-to-boost-your-vim-productivity/
