# Neo Vim dotfiles

All custom config is in `nvim/nvchad`

This directory is symlinked to `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/` during the dotfiles install.

## iTerm2 notes
- Make sure you install a Nerd font: such us `Jetbrains mono NL`
- Change the setting of `Profiles > keys > General > Left option key` to `Esc +`
