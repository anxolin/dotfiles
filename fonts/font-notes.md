# Meslo

Font based on apple Menlo.

There's multiple patched versions of this font.

- The one I use is the one recomended by `Powerlevel10K` ZSH plugin
- Works great with:
  - ZSH
  - vim Nerd Tree
  - Terminal text looks amazing
- More info in [https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts)

## Install the font

In Mac:

- Double click on each font, Font Book will ask you to import it
- Because there's many variants for the same font, Font Book will ask you if you want to replace or keep both
  - ⚠️ It's important to keep both! (so you have all variants for the same font)

## Other alternatives

In principle, we can use any **Nerd Font**

- See [https://www.nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- There's some pre-patched [https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

However, I recommend to stick to the one recommended by Power Level 10K plugin
